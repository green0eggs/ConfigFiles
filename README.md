ConfigFiles
===========

These are my dotfiles, there are many like them but these are mine.

This is probably not interesting for anyone but me: I have moved to the symbolic link approach Ã  la [github.com/rumblesan](http://github.com/rumblesan/dotfiles). 

I try to avoid vim plugins as much as possible. S'better to learn the native way imho.
